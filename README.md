# Tic-Tac-Toe

A tic tac toe game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

A simple tic tac toe game with a focus on the module design pattern for code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

This project enhances my javascript skills and my module pattern design skills because it is from the Javascript course from the odin project that focuses on javascript. Right now it only plays on the console, but I might play around and make it look nice on the front-end.

Edit: I did some css animations to make it look better, I feel like the blur is very laggy but oh well.
